1. Clicking on the simulation tab will get the user to the first page where, Torsional load - t<sub>0</sub>, frequency-&omega;, stifness of rotor 1-k<sub>1</sub>, polar momenet of inertia of rotor 1 - J<sub>1</sub>, stifness of rotor 2-k<sub>2</sub> and polar momenet of inertia of rotor 2 - J<sub>2</sub>

2. The simulation will change as the values are changed, clicking on the graph button, next to play/pause button will show the frequency response curve of the first rotor.
