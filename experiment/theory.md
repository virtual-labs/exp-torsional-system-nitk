The shaft can be divided into three segments, having rotational spring constants as k<sub>t1</sub>, k<sub>t2</sub> and k<sub>t3</sub>. The system also has
<br>* Mass moment of inertia J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>2</sub>, <br>* Torque M<sub>t1</sub> and M<sub>t2</sub>
<br>* Rotational degree of freedom &theta;<sub>1</sub> and &theta;<sub>2</sub>.

<br> The differential equations of rotational motion for the discs can be written as,
