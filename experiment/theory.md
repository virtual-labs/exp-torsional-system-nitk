The shaft can be divided into three segments, having rotational spring constants as k<sub>t1</sub>, k<sub>t2</sub>, and k<sub>t3</sub>, as shown in Figure 1.
<br>* Mass moment of inertia of the discs are J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>2</sub>, and M<sub>t1</sub> and M<sub>t2</sub> are the applied torque and the rotational degree of freedoms are &theta;<sub>1</sub> and &theta;<sub>2</sub>.  

<br> The differential equations of rotational motion for the discs can be written as,

Consider a harmonic oscillation where &theta;<sub>i</sub> = &Theta;<sub>i</sub> sin &omega;t. The frequencies can be obtained by equating the determinant to zero,
