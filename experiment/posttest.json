      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (b). Rotation in same direction does not result in torque.",
        "b": "Correct, the right is (b). Rotation in opposite direction results in torque.",

      "question": "A two rotor system will have",
      "answers": {
        "a": "One mode",

        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (b). The system has more than one rotors so the system is considered as 2 DOF system and does not have one mode but will have 2 modes.",
        "b": "Correct, the right is (b). The system has two rotors(or masses), so the system is considered as 2 DOF system and has 2 modes.",
        "c": "Option b is correct. The system has two rotors(or masses), so the system is considered as 2 DOF system and has 2 modes.",
        "d": "Option b is correct. The system has two rotors(or masses), so the system is considered as 2 DOF system and has 2 modes."
